# Calculator (Python Tkinter Project)

## Project Overview
This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Calculator** built using **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations such as **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**, and supports **decimal** and **parenthesis-based** expressions.  
The calculator provides a clean, simple, and user-friendly design ‚Äî ideal for beginners learning GUI development in Python.

---

## Objectives
- Build an interactive **calculator GUI** using Tkinter.  
- Implement **event-driven programming** to handle user button clicks.  
- Display live input and computed results.  
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully with an **error message**.  
- Include functional buttons like **DEL**, **C (Clear)**, and **= (Evaluate)**.

---

## Key Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ GUI Design
- Created a **Tkinter window** with customized background and layout.  
- Used **Label widget** to display user input and results.  
- Designed **Button widgets** for digits, operators, and control functions.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Functionality Implementation
- Defined `button_click()` function to:
  - Append clicked values to the display.
  - Evaluate the expression on pressing "=".
  - Clear or delete characters using "C" and "DEL".
- Used Python‚Äôs built-in **`eval()`** function to compute expressions safely within a try-except block.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Layout & Styling
- Organized all buttons using **Grid layout**.  
- Used consistent button sizing and fonts for better user experience.  
- Applied **color-coded buttons** for better visual distinction:  
  - `C` ‚Üí Red (Clear)  
  - `=` ‚Üí Green (Evaluate)
